# Thank you

To all of the [Trust-DNS contributors](https://github.com/bluejekyll/trust-dns/graphs/contributors), thank you so much. Without your support there would be many bugs, issues, and feature gaps that would never have been closed.

A special thank you to everyone who's contributed to [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/graphs/contributors), as without you this project would never have been started.

For all the security extensions to this library, thank you to the contributors of [\*ring\*](https://github.com/briansmith/ring/graphs/contributors), [rust-openssl](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/graphs/contributors), [rustls](https://github.com/ctz/rustls/graphs/contributors), [native-tls](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-native-tls), and others, without these detail oriented implementors, there would be no security support in Trust-DNS.

All of the nuts-and-bolts that makes Trust-DNS function across systems with nearly zero issues, thank you to the [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/graphs/contributors) contributors for an amazing, and not nearly loved enough, async framework.

Last but not least, for all the users of Trust-DNS, without you there would be no reason to work on this software. Thank you for taking a risk and using this software.
